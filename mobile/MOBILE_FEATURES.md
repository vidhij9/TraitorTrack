# TraceTrack Mobile App Features

This document outlines the key features and enhancements provided by the TraceTrack mobile app compared to the web application.

## Native Camera Integration

The TraceTrack mobile app enhances QR code scanning by utilizing the device's native camera capabilities through the Capacitor Camera plugin. This provides several advantages:

- **Improved scanning performance**: Native camera access typically offers better focus and faster scanning than web-based alternatives.
- **Better low-light handling**: Uses the device's built-in camera enhancements for improved scanning in various lighting conditions.
- **Access to camera features**: Can utilize device-specific camera features like flash.

## Offline Capabilities

The mobile app includes offline support through service workers, allowing users to:

- **Access recently viewed data**: Previously scanned bags and locations can be viewed offline.
- **Queue scans for later upload**: Scans made while offline are stored locally and uploaded when the device reconnects.
- **Install as a standalone app**: The PWA can be installed to the home screen and used without opening a browser.

## Native UI/UX Improvements

The app provides a more native-feeling user experience through:

- **Enhanced touch controls**: Larger touch targets and mobile-optimized interface elements.
- **Native navigation**: Hardware back button support and proper history management.
- **Status bar integration**: Custom styling of the status bar to match the app's theme.
- **Performance optimizations**: Smoother animations and transitions in the native app.

## Security Enhancements

The mobile app improves security in several ways:

- **Biometric authentication**: Can use the device's fingerprint or face recognition for login.
- **Secure local storage**: Uses the device's secure storage for sensitive information.
- **Custom user agent**: Helps identify and authorize requests from the mobile app.

## Location Tracking

When enabled, the mobile app can:

- **Capture GPS coordinates**: Automatically record the exact location where bags are scanned.
- **Show scan locations on map**: Display a map showing where each scan occurred.
- **Track bag journey**: Visualize the complete journey of a bag through the supply chain.

## Push Notifications

The mobile app can receive push notifications for:

- **New scans**: Alerts when bags are scanned at a new location.
- **Status updates**: Notifications for important status changes in the tracking process.
- **Assigned tasks**: Alerts for new scanning tasks assigned to the user.
