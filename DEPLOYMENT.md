## Environment Variables

### Required
```bash
# Database (auto-configured in Replit)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname

# Session Security (REQUIRED - set to random 32+ character string)
SESSION_SECRET=<generate-random-secret>

# Admin Account
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<secure-admin-password>
```

### Optional
```bash
# Environment detection (auto-set by Replit deployments)
REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT=1           # Enables HTTPS cookies
ENVIRONMENT=production        # Alternative production detection

# Email notifications (future feature - not yet configured)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your-key>   # When email feature is enabled

# EOD Summary Security (for scheduled jobs)
EOD_SECRET_KEY=<random-secret>  # For cron job authentication
```

### Generating Secrets
```bash
# Generate SESSION_SECRET
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Generate ADMIN_PASSWORD
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(24))"
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Setup
```bash
# Ensure all environment variables are set
echo $SESSION_SECRET  # Must be set
echo $ADMIN_PASSWORD  # Must be set
echo $DATABASE_URL    # Auto-configured in Replit
```

### 2. Database Initialization
The application automatically:
- Creates all tables on first run
- Sets up statistics_cache table with triggers
- Creates composite indexes for performance
- Initializes admin user

**Note:** Migrations are idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Production command (remove --reload for production):
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port main:app

# Current workflow command includes --reload for development:
# gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port --reload main:app

# Production configuration:
# - Uses sync worker (1 worker for Replit)
# - Listens on 0.0.0.0:5000
# - No auto-reload (stability and performance)
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
1. Access the application URL
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Check dashboard loads with real-time statistics
4. Verify system health metrics (admin only)
5. Test core workflows:
   - Create parent bag
   - Scan parent bag
   - Create child bag and link to parent
   - Generate bill
   - View audit logs

---

## Performance Targets

### ✅ Achieved Performance
- **Dashboard Stats**: <10ms (using statistics_cache)
- **List Operations**: <200ms for paginated results
- **Search Queries**: <300ms with indexes
- **Bag Lookups**: <50ms with query optimizer
- **Concurrent Users**: 100+ supported
- **Database Scale**: 1.8M+ bags tested

### Database Metrics (Expected)
- **Connection Pool**: 80 connections (25 base + 15 overflow × 2 workers)
- **Database Size**: Grows ~10-15 MB per 100k bags
- **Memory Usage**: ~80-120 MB per worker
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >60% after warm-up

---

## Monitoring Recommendations

### System Health Dashboard (Admin Only)
Monitor these metrics on the admin dashboard:
- **DB Connections**: Should stay well below 40 (configured max per worker)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Target >60% for optimal performance
- **Memory Usage**: Should remain stable under 200 MB per worker
- **DB Size**: Monitor growth rate
- **Errors (Last Hour)**: Should be 0 under normal operation

### Application Logs
Monitor for:
```bash
# Success indicators
grep "Database initialized successfully" logs
grep "Query optimizer initialized" logs

# Performance issues
grep "timeout" logs
grep "pool" logs

# Errors
grep "ERROR" logs
grep "CRITICAL" logs
```

### Database Health
```sql
-- Check statistics cache is updating
SELECT last_updated FROM statistics_cache WHERE id = 1;

-- Verify bag counts
SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM bag GROUP BY type;

-- Check connection usage
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = current_database();
```

## Scaling Guidelines

### Current Configuration (Single Worker)
- **Capacity**: 50-100 concurrent users
- **Database**: 1.8M+ bags
- **Memory**: ~80-120 MB

### Scaling to 2 Workers
Already configured:
- Connection pool: 80 connections (40 per worker)
- **Capacity**: 100-200 concurrent users

### Scaling Beyond 2 Workers
1. Adjust `SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS` in `app.py`:
   ```python
   "pool_size": 20,        # Reduce per worker
   "max_overflow": 10,     # Reduce per worker
   ```
2. Calculate: `total_connections = (pool_size + max_overflow) × workers`
3. Ensure: `total_connections < postgres max_connections - 10`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard Statistics Not Updating
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify statistics_cache exists
SELECT * FROM statistics_cache WHERE id = 1;

-- Force refresh if needed
-- (triggers auto-update on any bag/scan/bill change)
INSERT INTO bag (qr_id, name, type) VALUES ('TEST', 'Test', 'parent');
DELETE FROM bag WHERE qr_id = 'TEST';
```

### Issue: High Memory Usage
**Indicators**: Memory >500 MB per worker
**Solutions:**
1. Check for slow queries: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 10;`
2. Review cache size: Check `/api/system_health` cache metrics
3. Restart workers to clear in-memory cache

### Issue: Connection Pool Exhausted
**Indicators**: "QueuePool limit overflow" errors
**Solutions:**
1. Check `/api/system_health` connection pool usage
2. Identify long-running queries
3. Reduce concurrent user load or increase pool size

### Issue: Slow Dashboard Load
**Check:**
1. Statistics cache working: `SELECT last_updated FROM statistics_cache WHERE id = 1;`
2. Should update within seconds of any data change
3. If stale, check database triggers are installed

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback
Replit provides automatic checkpoints:
1. Use Replit's rollback feature in the UI
2. Select checkpoint before deployment
3. Confirm rollback (restores code, database, and chat history)

### Manual Database Rollback
```sql
-- Backup before major changes
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

-- Restore from backup
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup_20251024_133000.sql
```

## Disabled Features

### Email Notifications (Not Yet Configured)
- **Status**: Integration ready, but SENDGRID_API_KEY not configured
- **Impact**: EOD summaries must be accessed manually via `/eod_summary_preview`
- **To Enable**: Set SENDGRID_API_KEY and configure email templates

### Excel Upload (Temporarily Disabled)
- **Status**: Disabled for system optimization
- **Impact**: Bags must be created individually or via API
- **Alternative**: Use scanner interface or API batch creation
- **To Enable**: Implement optimized Excel processing module

See `FEATURES.md` for detailed status and alternatives.
