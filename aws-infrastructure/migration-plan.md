## QR Code Device Integration Strategy

### Device Integration Options
1. **HTTP API Integration**: Device posts scanned QR data to AWS endpoints
2. **WebSocket Real-time**: Real-time QR data streaming
3. **Batch Processing**: Bulk QR code processing for high-volume scenarios
4. **Edge Computing**: AWS IoT Core for device management

### Recommended Approach
```
QR Scanner Device → AWS IoT Core → Lambda → API Gateway → ECS Application
```

**Benefits:**
- Device management through AWS IoT Core
- Automatic scaling with Lambda
- Real-time processing capability
- Built-in security and authentication

### Implementation Plan
1. **API Endpoints**: Modify existing `/api/fast_parent_scan` for device integration
2. **Authentication**: Device-specific API keys via AWS Secrets Manager
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live scanning feedback
4. **Batch Processing**: Queue-based processing for high-volume scanning

## Cost Analysis

### Monthly Cost Estimate (Production)
| Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| ECS Fargate | 2-10 tasks (512 CPU, 1GB RAM) | $50-200 |
| RDS PostgreSQL | db.t3.medium, Multi-AZ | $120 |
| ElastiCache Redis | cache.t3.micro x 2 | $40 |
| Application Load Balancer | Standard ALB | $20 |
| CloudFront CDN | 1TB transfer | $85 |
| CloudWatch + X-Ray | Standard monitoring | $30 |
| **Total Estimated Cost** | | **$345-495/month** |

### Cost Optimization Features
- **Fargate Spot**: 80% cost reduction for non-critical tasks
- **Reserved Instances**: 30-60% savings for predictable workloads  
- **Auto-scaling**: Pay only for actual usage

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Application Performance**
   - Response times (avg, P95, P99)
   - Throughput (requests/second)
   - Error rates
   - Cache hit rates

2. **Infrastructure Health**
   - CPU/Memory utilization
   - Database connections
   - Auto-scaling events
   - Network latency

3. **Business Metrics**
   - QR scans processed
   - User sessions
   - Peak concurrent users
   - System availability

### Alerting Thresholds
- Response time > 100ms (Warning), > 200ms (Critical)
- Error rate > 1% (Warning), > 5% (Critical)
- CPU utilization > 70% (Warning), > 90% (Critical)
- Database connections > 80% (Warning), > 95% (Critical)

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- VPC with private subnets for application and database
- Security groups with least-privilege access
- WAF protection for web application
- SSL/TLS encryption in transit

### Data Security
- RDS encryption at rest
- ElastiCache encryption
- Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- IAM roles with minimal permissions

### Compliance
- CloudTrail for audit logging
- VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- Regular security assessments
- Automated backup and recovery

## Rollback Strategy

### Blue-Green Deployment
1. **Parallel Environment**: Maintain current Replit environment during migration
2. **Traffic Splitting**: Gradual traffic migration using Route 53
3. **Instant Rollback**: DNS switch back to Replit if issues occur
4. **Data Synchronization**: Real-time sync between environments during transition

### Rollback Triggers
- Response times > 500ms for 5 minutes
- Error rates > 10% for 2 minutes
- Database connection failures
- Critical functionality not working

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success Criteria
- [ ] Response times: avg <25ms, P95 <50ms, P99 <100ms
- [ ] Throughput: >500 requests/second
- [ ] Availability: >99.9% uptime
