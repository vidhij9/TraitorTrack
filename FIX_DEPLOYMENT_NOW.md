# üö® CRITICAL: Fix This Before Publishing!

## The Problem
Your app **WILL FAIL** when you try to publish it because the `.replit` file is using the wrong command.

## The Fix (Takes 30 seconds)

### Option 1: Edit .replit File Directly (Recommended)

1. **Open the file:** Click on `.replit` in your file list
2. **Find line 10:** Look for this line:
   ```toml
   run = ["sh", "-c", "python main.py"]
   ```
3. **Replace it with:**
   ```toml
   run = ["sh", "-c", "./start_production.sh"]
   ```
4. **Save the file**
5. **Done!** You can now publish successfully

### Option 2: Use Replit Deployment Settings

1. Click the **"Deploy"** or **"Publish"** button
2. Go to **"Configure Deployment"** or **"Settings"**
3. Find the **"Run Command"** field
4. Change it to:
   ```
   ./start_production.sh
   ```
5. **Save** and **Deploy**

## Why This is Critical

‚ùå **Current setup (python main.py):**
- Can only handle 1 user at a time
- Will crash under load
- Not suitable for production
- Can't scale

‚úÖ **Fixed setup (./start_production.sh):**
- Handles 100+ concurrent users
- Production-grade server (Gunicorn)
- Async workers for high performance
- Ready to scale

---

## What I've Prepared For You

‚úÖ **start_production.sh** - Production server script (ready to use)  
‚úÖ **DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Complete deployment guide  
‚úÖ **replit.md** - Updated with deployment info  

Everything is ready. You just need to update that one line in the `.replit` file!

---

## Quick Test Before Publishing

After making the change, test it works:

```bash
./start_production.sh
```

Then visit your app - it should start with Gunicorn and show:
```
Starting TraceTrack in PRODUCTION mode...
Gunicorn with gevent workers for high concurrency
```

## Need Help?

If you're not sure how to edit `.replit`, here's exactly what to do:

1. Look at your file list on the left
2. Find and click on `.replit`
3. Scroll to line 10 (around the middle of the file)
4. Change `python main.py` to `./start_production.sh`
5. Press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac) to save
6. Done!

The deployment is now ready to publish! üöÄ
