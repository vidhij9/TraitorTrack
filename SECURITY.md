# Security Features in TraceTrack

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the TraceTrack application to protect against common web vulnerabilities and ensure data safety.

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Password Strength Requirements**: Enforces strong passwords with minimum length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Account Lockout**: Implements temporary account lockouts after multiple failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with HTTPS-only cookies, session timeout, and protections against session fixation attacks.
- **Session Hijacking Detection**: Monitors for unusual changes in user agents or other session characteristics.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Restricts access to administrative features based on user roles.

## Input Validation and Sanitization

- **QR Code Validation**: Validates QR codes against predefined patterns to prevent injection attacks.
- **Form Input Sanitization**: Sanitizes all user inputs using the Bleach library to remove potentially harmful HTML or script content.
- **Data Type Validation**: Validates all user inputs for correct data types and formats before processing.

## Protection Against Common Attacks

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Implements CSRF tokens on all forms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Mitigates XSS vulnerabilities through input sanitization and content security policy headers.
- **SQL Injection**: Uses parameterized queries and input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting on sensitive endpoints to prevent abuse and denial of service attacks.

## Web Security Headers

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts the sources of content that can be loaded by the browser.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing to reduce exposure to attacks.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents the page from being framed to protect against clickjacking attacks.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables the browser's built-in XSS filtering.

## Secure Configuration

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Configures the application to use HTTPS for all communications.
- **Secure Cookie Settings**: Sets cookies with the Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite attributes.
- **Minimal Error Information**: Limits error information exposed to users to prevent information leakage.
- **Security Middleware**: Monitors requests for suspicious patterns and potential attacks.

## Security Testing

The application includes a security testing script (`security_test.py`) that can be used to verify the implementation of various security measures:

- XSS vulnerability testing
- CSRF protection verification
- Security header validation
- Rate limiting tests

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in TraceTrack, please report it by [contact information].

## Best Practices for Operators

- Regularly update all dependencies and libraries.
- Enable HTTPS in the production environment.
- Configure a strong secret key for the application.
- Regularly back up the database.
- Monitor the application logs for suspicious activity.
- Consider implementing additional security measures like a web application firewall (WAF).
