### Pre-Deployment Checklist

#### ✅ Immediate Actions Required
```bash
# 1. Set production environment
export FLASK_ENV=production
export FLASK_DEBUG=0

# 2. Verify database backup
pg_dump production_db > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# 3. Apply database indexes (if not exists)
python production_database_optimization.py

# 4. Test critical endpoints
curl https://production-url/health
curl https://production-url/api/stats
```

#### ⚠️ Deployment Steps
1. **Backup production database** before any changes
2. **Apply indexes** using optimization script
3. **Deploy code** with zero-downtime strategy
4. **Monitor performance** for first hour
5. **Check error logs** frequently

#### 🔄 Rollback Plan
1. Keep previous deployment ready
2. Database backup available
3. Monitor for 30 minutes post-deploy
4. Rollback if error rate > 1%
