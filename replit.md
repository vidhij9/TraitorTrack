# TraceTrack - Supply Chain Traceability Platform

## Overview

TraceTrack is a comprehensive supply chain traceability platform built for agricultural bag tracking and management. The system provides real-time tracking of parent and child bags through QR code scanning, bill management, and user authentication with role-based access control.

✓ Updated layout.html to use single responsive CSS file instead of multiple conflicting ones

✓ Added proper CSS custom properties for consistent theming across all devices
✓ Fixed navigation bar to work consistently on both mobile and desktop
✓ Replaced page-specific mobile-users.css with inline responsive styles
✓ Added support for extra_css block in layout.html for page-specific customizations
✓ Enhanced accessibility with proper focus states and reduced motion support

### Previous Changes (July 28, 2025)
✓ Fixed "View Bag Details" button 404 error by resolving route name inconsistencies
✓ Updated all template references from 'bag_detail' to 'bag_details' across the application
✓ Added URL encoding support for QR codes with special characters in templates
✓ Enhanced bag_details route to handle URL-encoded QR codes using Flask's <path:> converter
✓ Added QR code validation to prevent URLs from being stored as bag identifiers
✓ Implemented proper error handling for invalid QR codes containing URLs
✓ Fixed typo in bag_lookup_result.html ('bag_detailss' → 'bag_details')
✓ Replaced direct URL construction with Flask's url_for in edit_parent_children.html
✓ Added comprehensive template-level validation across all bag detail links
✓ Enhanced scan_details route with QR code validation to prevent URL-based errors

## System Architecture

## User Hierarchy System

The system implements a three-tier hierarchical role system:

### 2. Biller (Bill Management Access)
- Bill creation and editing rights
- Access to all dispatch areas
