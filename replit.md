# TraceTrack - Supply Chain Traceability Platform

## Overview
TraceTrack is a comprehensive supply chain traceability platform designed for agricultural bag tracking and management. It provides real-time tracking of parent and child bags via QR code scanning, robust bill management, and secure user authentication with role-based access control. The platform aims to streamline agricultural logistics by ensuring end-to-end traceability of products.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Camera permissions: Once granted on mobile devices, never ask again - implement persistent permission handling.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python) with optimized session-based authentication.
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM supporting PostgreSQL with query optimization layer.
- **Authentication**: Centralized authentication utilities with unified current user object.
- **API Design**: Optimized RESTful endpoints with rate limiting and response caching.
- **Caching**: High-performance in-memory cache with TTL and size management.
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times with optimized database queries and bulk operations.

### Frontend Architecture

### Critical Bug Fixes (August 11, 2025)
- **FIXED: Bag Role Conflicts**: Implemented comprehensive validation to prevent QR codes from being used as both parent and child bags
- **Business Logic Enhancement**: Added strict role enforcement - one QR code can only have one role (parent OR child, never both)
- **Multi-Layer Validation**: Added validation at route level, query optimizer level, and database creation level
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Clear error messages explaining why a QR code cannot be used in conflicting roles
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Comprehensive error handling for all scanning scenarios including QR code validation, duplicate detection, role conflicts, and database errors
- **Detailed Issue Reporting**: Error messages now include specific information about existing bag types, link counts, and database relationship issues

### Code Consolidation
- **Authentication**: Centralized all authentication logic in `auth_utils.py`
- **Database Operations**: Created `query_optimizer.py` for optimized database interactions
- **Caching**: Replaced old caching with high-performance `cache_manager.py`
- **API Layer**: Completely optimized API endpoints with proper rate limiting

### Files Removed
- Eliminated 7 redundant files: `duplicate_prevention.py`, `account_security.py`, `test_auth.py`, `setup_admin.py`, `cache_utils.py`, `production_auth_fix.py`, `simple_auth.py`
- Consolidated functionality into optimized utility modules

### Manual QR Entry Removal & Template Cleanup
- Completely removed all manual QR code entry functionality from the entire system
- Deleted `ScanParentForm` and `ScanChildForm` classes from `forms.py`
- Removed all manual entry sections from templates: `scan_child.html`, `scan_parent.html`, `scan_parent_ultra.html`, `scan_child_ultra.html`
- Cleaned up `live-qr-scanner.js` to remove manual entry modal, CSS, and JavaScript code
- Updated all route handlers to remove references to manual entry forms
- System now uses exclusively live camera scanning for QR code detection
- Primary scanning interface: `/scan/parent` → `scan_parent_ultra.html` (camera-only)
- Removed fallback routes and old/backup templates: `scan_parent_standard`, `scan_child_backup.html`, `scan_child_old.html`, `scan_parent.html`
- Created simplified camera-only `scan_bill_parent.html` for bill management functionality

### Database Configuration Simplification  
- Removed unused TestingConfig from database configurations
- Simplified from development/testing/production to development/production only
- Development environment uses Replit's public DATABASE_URL
- Production environment uses AWS_DATABASE_URL with fallback to PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL
- Updated both `config.py` and `app_clean.py` to align with simplified database setup

### System Design
The optimization has transformed TraceTrack into a high-performance, camera-only system with sub-second response times and significantly improved maintainability.
