# TraceTrack - Bag Tracking System

## Overview
TraceTrack is a high-performance web-based bag tracking system designed for warehouse and logistics operations. It efficiently manages parent-child bag relationships, scanning processes, and bill generation. The system is built to support over 100 concurrent users and handle more than 1.8 million bags, providing a production-ready interface for dispatchers, billers, and administrators with real-time tracking capabilities. Its core purpose is to streamline logistics, enhance operational efficiency, and provide robust, scalable bag management.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Application Structure
The project follows a standard Flask application structure, separating concerns into `models.py`, `routes.py`, `api.py`, and `forms.py`. Key architectural components include `query_optimizer.py` for high-performance database operations and `cache_utils.py` for caching strategies.

### Technical Implementation

**Backend Stack:**
- **Flask 3.1+**: Python web framework.
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0+**: ORM with optimized connection pooling.
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database.
- **Gunicorn + gevent**: Asynchronous WSGI server for concurrency.
- **Flask-Login**: Session-based authentication.
- **Flask-WTF**: Form validation and CSRF protection.
- **Flask-Limiter**: In-memory rate limiting.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Clean, production-ready web interface for dispatchers, billers, and administrators.
- AJAX-powered dashboard for real-time statistics.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Production-Scale Optimizations**:
    - **Statistics Cache System**: `statistics_cache` table with comprehensive database triggers ensures real-time, sub-10ms dashboard stats at any scale by avoiding expensive `COUNT(*)` queries.
    - **Connection Pool Optimization**: Configured for multi-worker environments (25 base + 15 overflow per worker, 80 total for 2 workers), ensuring high concurrency without exceeding database limits.
    - **API Pagination & Performance**: Strict limits (200 rows max, 10,000 max offset) and smart count strategies prevent performance bottlenecks for large datasets.
    - **Database Indexes**: Composite indexes on critical tables (Scan, AuditLog) optimize common query patterns for 1.8M+ records.
    - **High-Performance Query Optimizer (`query_optimizer.py`)**: Implements raw SQL and in-memory caching for critical operations like `get_bag_by_qr()`, `get_child_count_fast()`, and batch linking, significantly improving scanner and bill-linking workflow speeds.
    - **Smart Role-Aware Caching (`cache_utils.py`)**: Secure, high-performance caching system with separate decorators for global and user-specific data. Features automatic cache key generation including user identity, query parameters, and request context to prevent data leaks while maintaining 10x performance boost. Includes intelligent cache invalidation on data changes.
- **Session Management**: Filesystem-based sessions with a 1-hour lifetime, secured with HTTPOnly and SameSite=Lax cookies.
- **Security Features**: 
    - Requires `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable
    - Auto-detection of production environment (REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT=1 or ENVIRONMENT=production) enables HTTPS-only cookies
    - Secure password hashing (scrypt), CSRF protection, session validation, and security headers
    - In-memory rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **System Health Monitoring**:
    - Real-time metrics endpoint (`/api/system_health`) for admin users
    - Tracks database connection pool, cache performance, memory usage, database size, and error counts
    - Admin dashboard displays key system health indicators
- **Deployment**: Utilizes `gunicorn` with sync workers for efficient resource management, designed for cloud environments with environment variable-driven configuration.

### Feature Specifications
