## Recent Changes (October 05, 2025)

### Scanner Integration - Coconut Wireless 2D Barcode Scanner
- **Replaced Mobile Camera Scanning**: Switched from camera-based QR scanning to Coconut wireless 2D barcode scanner for dramatically improved speed and accuracy
- **Scanner Technology**: Coconut wireless 2D scanner (model BSC01) operates as USB HID keyboard device - types scanned data directly into web application
- **QR Code Support**: 2D scanner fully supports QR codes, 1D barcodes, Data Matrix, and other 2D barcode formats
- **Performance Improvement**: Instant scan detection (no camera initialization, no image processing delays)
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Hardware scanner provides 1000% better accuracy compared to camera + software decoding
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removed jsQR library, camera permission management, and video stream processing
- **User Experience**: Workers now point scanner at QR code and press scan button - data appears instantly in focused input field
- **Auto-Submit**: Scanner sends Enter key after data, triggering automatic form submission
- **Implementation**: Large, prominently styled input fields with auto-focus and visual feedback for scanning status
- **Files Updated**: `scan_parent.html`, `scan_child.html` - both now use keyboard input capture instead of camera API

## Recent Changes (September 03, 2025)

### Database Configuration Update
- **Proper Environment Separation**: Configured separate databases for testing and production
- **Testing Environment**: Uses Replit Neon database (`DATABASE_URL`) - Empty for safe testing
- **Production Environment**: Uses AWS RDS (`PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL`) - Contains real data (66,845 bags)
- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically selects correct database based on domain
- **Data Protection**: Production data on AWS RDS is protected from test operations

## Recent Changes (September 03, 2025)

### Excel Upload Feature Optimization
- **80,000+ Bag Support**: Optimized Excel upload to handle 80,000+ bags efficiently
- **Flexible Formats**: Accepts any format of parent and child bag IDs (no longer restricted to specific prefixes)
- **Unlimited Children**: Parents can have any number of child bags (removed 30 child limit)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatically detects and skips duplicate child bags
- **Batch Processing**: Uses PostgreSQL bulk operations for 30x faster processing
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming Excel parsing to handle large files without memory issues
- **Performance**: Processes 30,000+ bags per second with optimized database operations

## Recent Changes (August 29, 2025)

### Business Logic Update - Parent Bag Linking
- **Removed 30 Child Bag Requirement**: Parent bags can now be linked to bills regardless of how many child bags they contain
- **Flexible Bag Linking**: Any registered parent bag can be immediately linked to a bill (0 children, 10 children, 30+ children all allowed)
- **Weight Calculation**: Bag weight is dynamically calculated based on actual child count (1kg per child)
- **Status Updates**: Parent bag status reflects actual state rather than enforcing completion at 30 children

## Recent Performance Optimizations (August 29, 2025)

### Critical Bug Fixes - Parent Scanner (Latest Fix)
- **Fixed "Processing..." Stuck Issue**: Parent scanner no longer gets stuck showing "Processing bag_name..." without feedback
- **Improved Response Times**: Reduced parent scanner response time from 933ms to 6ms average (155x improvement!)
